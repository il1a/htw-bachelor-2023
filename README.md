### "Exploring the Efficacy of Diverse Classification Techniques In Detecting Disinformation In News."

You can find the original Kaggle dataset here: [Misinformation & Fake News text dataset 79k](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/stevenpeutz/misinformation-fake-news-text-dataset-79k?select=DataSet_Misinfo_TRUE.csv)

**Beware that full datasets aren't directly included in the repository due to their size and raw format!**

Under [Notebooks & Scripts](https://github.com/il1a/htw-bachelor-2023/tree/main/%5B1%5D%20Notebooks%20%26%20Scripts), you can find chronologically numbered jupyter notebooks that entail the entire technical implementation of the project, as well as subfolders [Data](https://github.com/il1a/htw-bachelor-2023/tree/main/%5B1%5D%20Notebooks%20%26%20Scripts/Data) and [Models](https://github.com/il1a/htw-bachelor-2023/tree/main/%5B1%5D%20Notebooks%20%26%20Scripts/Models) which contain .spacy and .pkl files, that allow simple loading of pre-formatted data frame and pre-trained algorithms.

> **Disclaimer!** Due to the data-related serialization files, when cloning, the total size of the project fluctuates around 800 MB, because of which the cloning process might take a minute or two.

Additionally, you can access both generated [Illustrations](https://github.com/il1a/htw-bachelor-2023/tree/main/%5B2%5D%20Illustrations) and [Tables](https://github.com/il1a/htw-bachelor-2023/tree/main/%5B3%5D%20Tables), which have been directly linked in the thesis or stored here as complementary appendices, under their designated folders.

---

Last but not least, in the main directory, you can find the [Anaconda Environment File](https://github.com/il1a/htw-bachelor-2023/blob/main/htw_thesis_conda_env.yaml) that can be directly imported as a new environment for simplified project compatibility. And as an alternative to conda environment, there is also [requirements.txt](https://github.com/il1a/htw-bachelor-2023/blob/main/requirements.txt) that can be used for a chained installation of all the required project packages with pip.
